- forM -> mapM with its arguments flipped
- mapM :: (Monad m) => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m [b]
- for:: (Monad m) => [a] -> (a -> m b) -> m [b]

- filterM -> evaluates pred in IO monad

- combinators: functions that take other functions and return new functions

- avoid pipelines longer than 3-4 elements
