data BookInfo = Book Int String [String]
  deriving (Show)

BookInfo  == type constructor
Book      == value/data constructor

- type constructors are only used in type declarations and type signatures
- value/data constructors are used in code to create values of the type
- type constructors and value constructors can share the same name

type CustomerID = Int == type synonym
type BookRecord = (BookInfo, BookReview) == type synonym for the tuple (BookInfo, BookReview)

- Bool is an algebraic data type - can have more than one value constructor

- algebraic datatypes allow us to distinguish between otherwise identical pieces of information - no way of confusing a whale with a chair

- Maybe is a polymorphic/generic type

- isomorphic types have similar shapes
